 <h2>The Tale of the Sands by Idries Shah</h2>
 <p>We all fear change and yet change is the very essence of life. How does a stream cross the mighty, <br />desolate desert? Can it allow itself to change its very form to survive the journey? <br />The Tale of the Sands helps the reader absorb the lesson that change can transform us, if only we have the courage to embrace it.</p>
<p><b>The only characters in this book are a beautiful</b>, flowing stream, <br /> a mighty, dry desert, <i>the wind and the voice of faith that lives within us all</i>. <br />As the stream confronts its many fears of being subsumed by the wind,<br /> the voice reminds us that change allows us to grow, move and prosper.</p>
